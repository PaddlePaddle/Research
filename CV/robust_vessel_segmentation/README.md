## Introduction

### This repository has the source code for the paper "Robust retinal vessel segmentation from a data augmentation perspective" .

We provide the implementation of the proposed data augmentation methods, namely, channel-wise random gamma correction and channel-wise random vessel augmentation. You may run the **data\_augmentation\_demo** notebook to see how these two methods work. 

Since the vessel segmentation model could be easily trained based on the [PaddleSeg](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg) library, here we only show how the exported **PaddlePaddle** inference model (trained on the DRIVE training set using the proposed data augmentation methods) could be used for segmenting real-world retinal fundus images. Interested readers could refer to the **vessel\_segmentation\_demo.py** file for details.

## Configuration

This code has been tested on python3.6 environment with the folloing site-packages:

    matplotlib==2.2.2
    numpy==1.16.4
    opencv-python==3.4.3
    paddlepaddle-gpu==1.6.2
    
To execute the vessel segmentation demo, you should download the inference model weights [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PrA0KyYNamfm9UrDO3nLVA) (fetch code: 63kp), and then put them into the pdl_assets directory.
After that, run the following script:

    python vessel_segmentation_demo.py
    
This demo takes the domo.jpg (a compressed image from the DRIVE test set) as input and generates an image with the extracted vessel mask.
