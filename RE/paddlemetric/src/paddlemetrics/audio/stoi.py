class STOI(Metric):
    r"""STOI (Short Term Objective Intelligibility, see [2,3]), a wrapper for the pystoi package [1].
    Note that input will be moved to `cpu` to perform the metric calculation.

    Intelligibility measure which is highly correlated with the intelligibility of degraded speech signals, e.g., due
    to additive noise, single/multi-channel noise reduction, binary masking and vocoded speech as in CI simulations.
    The STOI-measure is intrusive, i.e., a function of the clean and degraded speech signals. STOI may be a good
    alternative to the speech intelligibility index (SII) or the speech transmission index (STI), when you are
    interested in the effect of nonlinear processing to noisy speech, e.g., noise reduction, binary masking algorithms,
    on speech intelligibility. Description taken from [Cees Taal's website](http://www.ceestaal.nl/code/).

    .. note:: using this metrics requires you to have ``pystoi`` install. Either install as ``pip install
        paddlemetrics[audio]`` or ``pip install pystoi``

    Forward accepts

    - ``preds``: ``shape [...,time]``
    - ``target``: ``shape [...,time]``

    Args:
        fs:
            sampling frequency (Hz)
        extended:
            whether to use the extended STOI described in [4]
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and returns None if this is set to False. default: True
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step.
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called. default: None (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When `None`, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather.

    Returns:
        average STOI value

    Raises:
        ModuleNotFoundError:
            If ``pystoi`` package is not installed

    Example:
        >>> from paddlemetrics.audio import STOI
        >>> import torchapi as B
        >>> g = B.manual_seed(1)
        >>> preds = B.randn(8000)
        >>> target = B.randn(8000)
        >>> stoi = STOI(8000, False)
        >>> stoi(preds, target)
        tensor(-0.0100)
