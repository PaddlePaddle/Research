class KID(Metric):
    r"""
    Calculates Kernel Inception Distance (KID) which is used to access the quality of generated images. Given by

    .. math::
        KID = MMD(f_{real}, f_{fake})^2

    where :math:`MMD` is the maximum mean discrepancy and :math:`I_{real}, I_{fake}` are extracted features
    from real and fake images, see [1] for more details. In particular, calculating the MMD requires the
    evaluation of a polynomial kernel function :math:`k`

    .. math::
        k(x,y) = (\gamma * x^T y + coef)^{degree}

    which controls the distance between two features. In practise the MMD is calculated over a number of
    subsets to be able to both get the mean and standard deviation of KID.

    Using the default feature extraction (Inception v3 using the original weights from [2]), the input is
    expected to be mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape (3 x H x W) with dtype uint8. All images
    will be resized to 299 x 299 which is the size of the original training data.

    .. note:: using this metric with the default feature extractor requires that ``torch-fidelity``
        is installed. Either install as ``pip install paddlemetrics[image]`` or
        ``pip install torch-fidelity``

    .. note:: the ``forward`` method can be used but ``compute_on_step`` is disabled by default (oppesit of
        all other metrics) as this metric does not really make sense to calculate on a single batch. This
        means that by default ``forward`` will just call ``update`` underneat.

    Args:
        feature:
            Either an str, integer or ``nn.Module``:

            - an str or integer will indicate the inceptionv3 feature layer to choose. Can be one of the following:
              'logits_unbiased', 64, 192, 768, 2048
            - an ``nn.Module`` for using a custom feature extractor. Expects that its forward method returns
              an ``[N,d]`` matrix where ``N`` is the batch size and ``d`` is the feature size.

        subsets:
            Number of subsets to calculate the mean and standard deviation scores over
        subset_size:
            Number of randomly picked samples in each subset
        degree:
            Degree of the polynomial kernel function
        gamma:
            Scale-length of polynomial kernel. If set to ``None`` will be automatically set to the feature size
        coef:
            Bias term in the polynomial kernel.
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and return ``None`` if this is set to ``False``.
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called.
            default: ``None`` (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When ``None``, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather
