    """The Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (`LPIPS_`) is used to judge the perceptual similarity between
    two images. LPIPS essentially computes the similarity between the activations of two image patches for some
    pre-defined network. This measure have been shown to match human perseption well. A low LPIPS score means that
    image patches are perceptual similar.

    Both input image patches are expected to have shape `[N, 3, H, W]` and be normalized to the [-1,1]
    range. The minimum size of `H, W` depends on the chosen backbone (see `net_type` arg).

    .. note:: using this metrics requires you to have ``lpips`` package installed. Either install
        as ``pip install paddlemetrics[image]`` or ``pip install lpips``

    .. note:: this metric is not scriptable when using ``torch<1.8``. Please update your pytorch installation
        if this is a issue.

    Args:
        net_type: str indicating backbone network type to use. Choose between `'alex'`, `'vgg'` or `'squeeze'`
        reduction: str indicating how to reduce over the batch dimension. Choose between `'sum'` or `'mean'`.
        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and return ``None`` if this is set to ``False``.
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called.
            default: ``None`` (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When ``None``, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``lpips`` package is not installed
        ValueError:
            If ``net_type`` is not one of ``"vgg"``, ``"alex"`` or ``"squeeze"``
        ValueError:
            If ``reduction`` is not one of ``"mean"`` or ``"sum"``
