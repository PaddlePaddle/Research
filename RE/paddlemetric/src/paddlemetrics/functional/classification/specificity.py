    Computes `Specificity`_

    .. math:: \text{Specificity} = \frac{\text{TN}}{\text{TN} + \text{FP}}

    Where :math:`\text{TN}` and :math:`\text{FP}` represent the number of true negatives and
    false positives respecitively. With the use of ``top_k`` parameter, this metric can
    generalize to Specificity@K.

    The reduction method (how the specificity scores are aggregated) is controlled by the
    ``average`` parameter, and additionally by the ``mdmc_average`` parameter in the
    multi-dimensional multi-class case. Accepts all inputs listed in :ref:`references/modules:input types`.

    Args:
        preds: Predictions from model (probabilities, or labels)
        target: Ground truth values
        average:
            Defines the reduction that is applied. Should be one of the following:

            - ``'micro'`` [default]: Calculate the metric globally, across all samples and classes.
            - ``'macro'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes (with equal weights for each class).
            - ``'weighted'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes, weighting each class by its support (``tn + fp``).
            - ``'none'`` or ``None``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and return
              the metric for every class.
            - ``'samples'``: Calculate the metric for each sample, and average the metrics
              across samples (with equal weights for each sample).

            .. note:: What is considered a sample in the multi-dimensional multi-class case
                depends on the value of ``mdmc_average``.

            .. note:: If ``'none'`` and a given class doesn't occur in the `preds` or `target`,
                the value for the class will be ``nan``.

        mdmc_average:
            Defines how averaging is done for multi-dimensional multi-class inputs (on top of the
            ``average`` parameter). Should be one of the following:

            - ``None`` [default]: Should be left unchanged if your data is not multi-dimensional
              multi-class.

            - ``'samplewise'``: In this case, the statistics are computed separately for each
              sample on the ``N`` axis, and then averaged over samples.
              The computation for each sample is done by treating the flattened extra axes ``...``
              (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`) as the ``N`` dimension within the sample,
              and computing the metric for the sample based on that.

            - ``'global'``: In this case the ``N`` and ``...`` dimensions of the inputs
              (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`)
              are flattened into a new ``N_X`` sample axis, i.e. the inputs are treated as if they
              were ``(N_X, C)``. From here on the ``average`` parameter applies as usual.

        ignore_index:
            Integer specifying a target class to ignore. If given, this class index does not contribute
            to the returned score, regardless of reduction method. If an index is ignored, and ``average=None``
            or ``'none'``, the score for the ignored class will be returned as ``nan``.

        num_classes:
            Number of classes. Necessary for ``'macro'``, ``'weighted'`` and ``None`` average methods.

        threshold:
            Threshold probability value for transforming probability predictions to binary
            (0,1) predictions, in the case of binary or multi-label inputs
        top_k:
            Number of highest probability entries for each sample to convert to 1s - relevant
            only for inputs with probability predictions. If this parameter is set for multi-label
            inputs, it will take precedence over ``threshold``. For (multi-dim) multi-class inputs,
            this parameter defaults to 1.

            Should be left unset (``None``) for inputs with label predictions.
        multiclass:
            Used only in certain special cases, where you want to treat inputs as a different type
            than what they appear to be. See the parameter's
            :ref:`documentation section <references/modules:using the multiclass parameter>`
            for a more detailed explanation and examples.

    Return:
        The shape of the returned tensor depends on the ``average`` parameter

        - If ``average in ['micro', 'macro', 'weighted', 'samples']``, a one-element tensor will be returned
        - If ``average in ['none', None]``, the shape will be ``(C,)``, where ``C`` stands  for the number
          of classes

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``average`` is not one of ``"micro"``, ``"macro"``, ``"weighted"``,
            ``"samples"``, ``"none"`` or ``None``.
        ValueError:
            If ``mdmc_average`` is not one of ``None``, ``"samplewise"``, ``"global"``.
        ValueError:
            If ``average`` is set but ``num_classes`` is not provided.
        ValueError:
            If ``num_classes`` is set
            and ``ignore_index`` is not in the range ``[0, num_classes)``.

        >>> from paddlemetrics.functional import specificity
        >>> preds  = B.tensor([2, 0, 2, 1])
        >>> target = B.tensor([1, 1, 2, 0])
