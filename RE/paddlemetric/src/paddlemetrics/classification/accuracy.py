class Accuracy(StatScores):
    r"""
    Computes Accuracy_:

    .. math::
        \text{Accuracy} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N 1(y_i = \hat{y}_i)

    Where :math:`y` is a tensor of target values, and :math:`\hat{y}` is a
    tensor of predictions.

    For multi-class and multi-dimensional multi-class data with probability or logits predictions, the
    parameter ``top_k`` generalizes this metric to a Top-K accuracy metric: for each sample the
    top-K highest probability or logit score items are considered to find the correct label.

    For multi-label and multi-dimensional multi-class inputs, this metric computes the "global"
    accuracy by default, which counts all labels or sub-samples separately. This can be
    changed to subset accuracy (which requires all labels or sub-samples in the sample to
    be correctly predicted) by setting ``subset_accuracy=True``.

    Accepts all input types listed in :ref:`references/modules:input types`.

    Args:
        num_classes:
            Number of classes. Necessary for ``'macro'``, ``'weighted'`` and ``None`` average methods.
        threshold:
            Threshold for transforming probability or logit predictions to binary (0,1) predictions, in the case
            of binary or multi-label inputs. Default value of 0.5 corresponds to input being probabilities.
        average:
            Defines the reduction that is applied. Should be one of the following:

            - ``'micro'`` [default]: Calculate the metric globally, across all samples and classes.
            - ``'macro'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes (with equal weights for each class).
            - ``'weighted'``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and average the
              metrics across classes, weighting each class by its support (``tp + fn``).
            - ``'none'`` or ``None``: Calculate the metric for each class separately, and return
              the metric for every class.
            - ``'samples'``: Calculate the metric for each sample, and average the metrics
              across samples (with equal weights for each sample).

            .. note:: What is considered a sample in the multi-dimensional multi-class case
                depends on the value of ``mdmc_average``.

            .. note:: If ``'none'`` and a given class doesn't occur in the `preds` or `target`,
                the value for the class will be ``nan``.

        mdmc_average:
            Defines how averaging is done for multi-dimensional multi-class inputs (on top of the
            ``average`` parameter). Should be one of the following:

            - ``None`` [default]: Should be left unchanged if your data is not multi-dimensional
              multi-class.

            - ``'samplewise'``: In this case, the statistics are computed separately for each
              sample on the ``N`` axis, and then averaged over samples.
              The computation for each sample is done by treating the flattened extra axes ``...``
              (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`) as the ``N`` dimension within the sample,
              and computing the metric for the sample based on that.

            - ``'global'``: In this case the ``N`` and ``...`` dimensions of the inputs
              (see :ref:`references/modules:input types`)
              are flattened into a new ``N_X`` sample axis, i.e. the inputs are treated as if they
              were ``(N_X, C)``. From here on the ``average`` parameter applies as usual.

        ignore_index:
            Integer specifying a target class to ignore. If given, this class index does not contribute
            to the returned score, regardless of reduction method. If an index is ignored, and ``average=None``
            or ``'none'``, the score for the ignored class will be returned as ``nan``.

        top_k:
            Number of highest probability or logit score predictions considered to find the correct label,
            relevant only for (multi-dimensional) multi-class inputs. The
            default value (``None``) will be interpreted as 1 for these inputs.

            Should be left at default (``None``) for all other types of inputs.

        multiclass:
            Used only in certain special cases, where you want to treat inputs as a different type
            than what they appear to be. See the parameter's
            :ref:`documentation section <references/modules:using the multiclass parameter>`
            for a more detailed explanation and examples.

        subset_accuracy:
            Whether to compute subset accuracy for multi-label and multi-dimensional
            multi-class inputs (has no effect for other input types).

            - For multi-label inputs, if the parameter is set to ``True``, then all labels for
              each sample must be correctly predicted for the sample to count as correct. If it
              is set to ``False``, then all labels are counted separately - this is equivalent to
              flattening inputs beforehand (i.e. ``preds = preds.flatten()`` and same for ``target``).

            - For multi-dimensional multi-class inputs, if the parameter is set to ``True``, then all
              sub-sample (on the extra axis) must be correct for the sample to be counted as correct.
              If it is set to ``False``, then all sub-samples are counter separately - this is equivalent,
              in the case of label predictions, to flattening the inputs beforehand (i.e.
              ``preds = preds.flatten()`` and same for ``target``). Note that the ``top_k`` parameter
              still applies in both cases, if set.

        compute_on_step:
            Forward only calls ``update()`` and return ``None`` if this is set to ``False``.
        dist_sync_on_step:
            Synchronize metric state across processes at each ``forward()``
            before returning the value at the step
        process_group:
            Specify the process group on which synchronization is called.
            default: ``None`` (which selects the entire world)
        dist_sync_fn:
            Callback that performs the allgather operation on the metric state. When ``None``, DDP
            will be used to perform the allgather

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``top_k`` is not an ``integer`` larger than ``0``.
        ValueError:
            If ``average`` is none of ``"micro"``, ``"macro"``, ``"weighted"``, ``"samples"``, ``"none"``, ``None``.
        ValueError:
            If two different input modes are provided, eg. using ``multi-label`` with ``multi-class``.
        ValueError:
            If ``top_k`` parameter is set for ``multi-label`` inputs.

    Example:
        >>> import paddleext.torchapi as B
        >>> from paddlemetrics import Accuracy
        >>> target = B.tensor([0, 1, 2, 3])
        >>> preds = B.tensor([0, 2, 1, 3])
        >>> accuracy = Accuracy()
        >>> accuracy(preds, target)
        tensor(0.5000)

        >>> target = B.tensor([0, 1, 2])
        >>> preds = B.tensor([[0.1, 0.9, 0], [0.3, 0.1, 0.6], [0.2, 0.5, 0.3]])
        >>> accuracy = Accuracy(top_k=2)
        >>> accuracy(preds, target)
        tensor(0.6667)
