# DuReader<sub>robust</sub> Dataset
Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is a crucial and challenging task in natural language processing (NLP). In recent years, with the development of deep learning and the increasing availability of large-scale datasets, MRC has achieved remarkable advancements. Although a number of MRC models obtains human parity performance on several datasets, we find that these models are still far from robust in the scenario of real-world applications. 

To comprehensively evaluate the robustness of MRC models, we create a Chinese dataset, namely DuReader<sub>robust</sub>. It is designed to challenge MRC models from the following aspects: (1) over-sensitivity, (2) over-stability and (3) generalization. Besides, DuReader<sub>robust</sub> has another advantage over previous datasets: questions and documents are from Baidu Search. It presents the robustness issues of MRC models when applying them to real-world applications.  

For more details about the dataset, please refer to this [paper](#).

# DuReader<sub>robust</sub> Baseline System
In this repository, we release a baseline system for DuReader<sub>robust</sub> dataset. The baseline system is based on [ERNIE 1.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09223), and is implemented with [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/) framework. To run the baseline system, please follow the instructions below.

## Environment Requirements
The baseline system has been tested on

 - CentOS 6.3
 - PaddlePaddle 1.6.1 
 - Python 2.7.13 & Python 3.7.3
 - Cuda 9.0
 - CuDnn 7.0
 - NCCL 2.2.13
 
To install PaddlePaddle, please see the [PaddlePaddle Homepage](http://paddlepaddle.org/) for more information.


## Download
Before run the baseline system, please download the DuReader<sub>robust</sub> dataset and the pretrained model parameters (ERNIE 1.0 base):

```
sh download.sh
```
The dataset will be saved into `data/`, the pretrained and fine-tuned model parameters will be saved into `pretrained_model/` and `finetuned_model/`, respectively. Note that the fine-tuned model was fine-tuned from the training data based on the pretrained model (ERNIE 1.0). 

The descriptions of the data structure can be found in `data/README.md`. 

## Run Baseline

### Training
To fine-tune a model (on the demo dataset), please run the following command:

```
sh train.sh --train_file data/demo/demo_train.json --predict_file data/demo/demo_dev.json 
```
This will start the training process on the demo dataset. At the end of training, model parameters and predictions will be saved into `output/`. 

To train the model with user specified arguments (e.g. multi-GPUs, more epochs and larger batch size), please run the following command:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 sh train.sh --epoch 5 --batch_size 8 --train_file data/demo/demo_train.json --predict_file data/demo/demo_dev.json 
```
You can also directly modify the arguments in `train.sh`. More arguments can be found in `src/run_mrc.py`.

### Prediction
To predict with fine-tuned parameters, (e.g. on the devlopment set), please run the following command:

```
CKPT=<your_model_dir> sh predict.sh --predict_file data/dev.json
```
The model parameters under `your_model_dir` (e.g. `finetuned_model` as we have provided) will be loaded for prediction. The predicted answers will be saved into `output/`.

## Evaluation
F1-score and exact match (EM) are used as evaluation metrics. Here we provide a script `evaluate.py` for evaluation.

To evluate, run

```
python evaluate.py <reference_file> <prediction_file>
```
Where `<reference_file>` is the dataset file (e.g. `data/dev.json`), and `<prediction_file>` is the model prediction (e.g. `output/dev_predictions.json`) that should be a valid JSON file of (qid, answer) pairs, for example:

```
{
    "question_id_1" : "answer for question 1",
    ...
    "question_id_N": "answer for question N"
}
```

After runing the evaluation script, you will get the evaluation results with the following format:

```
{"F1": "80.842", "EM": "69.019", "TOTAL": 1417, "SKIP": 0}
```

## Baseline Performance
The performance of our baseline model (i.e. the fine-tuned model we provided above) are shown below:

| Dataset | F1 | EM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| basic dev | 80.84 | 69.02 |


## PaddleHub Baseline

To get the competition started quickly, we also release the baseline based on PaddleHub (https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHub). PaddleHub is an application toolkit for pre-trained models of PaddlePaddle(『飞桨』预训练模型应用工具).

What's your need is to install the latest paddlehub toolkit by the command 
```shell
pip install --upgrade paddlehub
```

Then, run 

```shell
cd paddlehub_baseline
sh paddlehub_reading_comprehension.sh
```

You will fine-tune the ERNIE pretrained model on the competition dataset and get the final prediction results.

Now, you can submit the results to the competition.

All questions about [PaddleHub](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHub), 
you can raise an issue (https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleHub/issues). We will reply as soon as possible.

The same codes also are released on the [demo](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/projectdetail/434707).
