def retrieval_r_precision(preds: Tensor, target: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """Computes the r-precision metric (for information retrieval). R-Precision is the fraction of relevant
    documents among all the top ``k`` retrieved documents where ``k`` is equal to the total number of relevant
    documents.

    ``preds`` and ``target`` should be of the same shape and live on the same device. If no ``target`` is ``True``,
    ``0`` is returned. ``target`` must be either `bool` or `integers` and ``preds`` must be `float`,
    otherwise an error is raised. If you want to measure Precision@K, ``k`` must be a positive integer.

    Args:
        preds: estimated probabilities of each document to be relevant.
        target: ground truth about each document being relevant or not.

    Returns:
        a single-value tensor with the r-precision of the predictions ``preds`` w.r.t. the labels ``target``.

    Example:
        >>> preds = tensor([0.2, 0.3, 0.5])
        >>> target = tensor([True, False, True])
        >>> retrieval_r_precision(preds, target)
        tensor(0.5000)
