    This ensures that preds and target take one of the shape/type combinations that are

    over-rides with ``multiclass`` by checking (for multi-class and multi-dim multi-class
    cases) that there are only up to 2 distinct labels.

    In case where preds are floats (probabilities), it is checked whether they are in [0,1] interval.

    When ``num_classes`` is given, it is checked that it is consistent with input cases (binary,
    multi-label, ...), and that, if available, the implied number of classes in the ``C``
    dimension is consistent with it (as well as that max label in target is smaller than it).

    When ``num_classes`` is not specified in these cases, consistency of the highest target
    value against ``C`` dimension is checked for (multi-dimensional) multi-class cases.

    If ``top_k`` is set (not None) for inputs that do not have probability predictions (and
    are not binary), an error is raised. Similarly if ``top_k`` is set to a number that
    is higher than or equal to the ``C`` dimension of ``preds``, an error is raised.

            (0,1) predictions, in the case of binary or multi-label inputs.
        num_classes:
            Number of classes. If not explicitly set, the number of classes will be inferred
            either from the shape of inputs, or the maximum label in the ``target`` and ``preds``
            tensor, where applicable.
        top_k:
            Number of highest probability entries for each sample to convert to 1s - relevant

            interpreted as 1 for these inputs. If this parameter is set for multi-label inputs,

      and is integer (multi-dimensional multi-class)
    * preds and target are of shape ``(N, ...)`` both are integers (multi-dimensional
      multi-class)

    To avoid ambiguities, all dimensions of size 1, except the first one, are squeezed out.

    The returned output tensors will be binary tensors of the same shape, either ``(N, C)``
    of ``(N, C, X)``, the details for each case are described below. The function also returns
    a ``case`` string, which describes which of the above cases the inputs belonged to - regardless
    of whether this was "overridden" by other settings (like ``multiclass``).

    In binary case, targets are normally returned as ``(N,1)`` tensor, while preds are transformed
    into a binary tensor (elements become 1 if the probability is greater than or equal to
    ``threshold`` or 0 otherwise). If ``multiclass=True``, then then both targets are preds
    become ``(N, 2)`` tensors by a one-hot transformation; with the thresholding being applied to
    preds first.

    In multi-class case, normally both preds and targets become ``(N, C)`` binary tensors; targets
    by a one-hot transformation and preds by selecting ``top_k`` largest entries (if their original
    shape was ``(N,C)``). However, if ``multiclass=False``, then targets and preds will be
    returned as ``(N,1)`` tensor.

    In multi-label case, normally targets and preds are returned as ``(N, C)`` binary tensors, with
    preds being binarized as in the binary case. Here the ``C`` dimension is obtained by flattening
    all dimensions after the first one. However if ``multiclass=True``, then both are returned as
    ``(N, 2, C)``, by an equivalent transformation as in the binary case.

    In multi-dimensional multi-class case, normally both target and preds are returned as
    ``(N, C, X)`` tensors, with ``X`` resulting from flattening of all dimensions except ``N`` and
    ``C``. The transformations performed here are equivalent to the multi-class case. However, if
    ``multiclass=False`` (and there are up to two classes), then the data is returned as
    ``(N, X)`` binary tensors (multi-label).

    Note:
        Where a one-hot transformation needs to be performed and the number of classes
        is not implicitly given by a ``C`` dimension, the new ``C`` dimension will either be
        equal to ``num_classes``, if it is given, or the maximum label value in preds and
        target.

        preds: Tensor with predictions (labels or probabilities)

            Number of highest probability entries for each sample to convert to 1s - relevant

            Should be left unset (``None``) for all other types of inputs.
